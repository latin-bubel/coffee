# coffee

# Description

The goal of this project was to create a simple website in order to learn basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I have decided to created a page showing of different coffee types and recipies by hovering on the coffee image.

At the bottom of the page you may get help choosing a coffee to drink by clicking on a button and typing in your name and if you are a dairy or non-dairy drinker. 

A selected coffee type will apear in the place of the button. 

Feel free to open my project which has been created during SheCodes Basics Class 👩‍💻
